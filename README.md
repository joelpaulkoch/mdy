# MDy

A live server for html and markdown including mermaid charts.
Basically, I was reaching for such a tool 3 times in 3 weeks to work on mermaid diagrams.
Every time I forgot which tool I was using, so I decided to build my own that I remember.

Build it

```bash
  mix deps.get
  mix release
```

then run it with one of

 * `burrito_out/mdy_linux`
 * `burrito_out/mdy_linux_arm`
 * `burrito_out/mdy_macos`
 * `burrito_out/mdy_macos_arm`
 * `burrito_out/mdy_windows.exe`
